# Benchmarks

This directory contains performance experiments. Keep
workloads deterministic and focused enough that a result can be tied to one
implementation choice.

Nob builds an optimized interpreter and runs every workload by default. The
commands below assume the bootstrapped Nob executable is available as `nob`;
use its actual path when it is not on `PATH`.

```console
nob benchmark
```

Select workloads, change the sample count, choose another build mode, or use an
existing executable:

```console
nob benchmark vector --runs 10
nob --cc clang --mode profile benchmark dispatch
nob benchmark dispatch --toy path/to/toy
```

## Comparing Two Builds

Use paired comparison for optimization experiments instead of running all
baseline samples and then all candidate samples:

```console
nob benchmark dispatch runtime-internals \
  --compare path/to/baseline/toy path/to/candidate/toy
```

Comparison mode runs one unmeasured warmup per executable and workload, then
15 measured pairs by default. Odd pairs run the baseline first; even pairs run
the candidate first. It reports both wall-time medians and the median of
`candidate / baseline` for matching pairs. The paired ratio is the primary
result because it is less sensitive to gradual changes in temperature, CPU
frequency, and background activity.

Use `--runs` to change the number of pairs and `--warmup` when a workload needs
more preparation:

```console
nob benchmark dispatch \
  --compare path/to/baseline/toy path/to/candidate/toy \
  --runs 21 --warmup 2
```

With no workload names, comparison mode runs every Toy benchmark. It does not
run C benchmarks: those are compiled artifacts rather than source workloads
that can be passed to two Toy executables. Workload output is hidden during a
comparison so that the paired record stays readable, but a nonzero process
exit still fails the run.

The comparison header records executable paths, platform, logical processor
count, pair count, and warmups. Save the complete output alongside a durable
result note. For example, in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\nob.exe benchmark dispatch --compare old\toy.exe new\toy.exe 2>&1 |
    Tee-Object build\dispatch-comparison.txt
```

The runner cannot infer which commits and compiler flags produced arbitrary
executables, the CPU model, or the active power plan. Record those separately
when promoting a result to `benchmarks/results/`.

It also deliberately does not change process priority, CPU affinity, or the
host power policy. Those controls are platform-specific and can make a result
less representative; both children simply inherit the same environment. When
in doubt, compare an executable with itself. A ratio that does not settle near
1.0 means the workload is too short or the machine is too variable for the
size of effect being investigated.

The Toy scripts use `monotonic-ns` and print integer nanosecond durations for
individual operations. C workloads are compiled against the matching runtime
and report their own operation timings in the same way. The runner also reports
wall time for each fresh process and its median. A custom `--toy` executable can
run only Toy-script workloads. Compare results only across the same machine,
compiler, build configuration, and workload. Store durable measurements under
`results/` using the provided template.

For guidance on drawing conclusions, choosing control workloads, or combining
timing with counters, allocation statistics, profiles, and leak checks, see
[`docs/development/observability.md`](../docs/development/observability.md).

Current workloads:

- `call-path.toy`: checksum-validated inline, user-word, quotation and symbol
  calls, boolean versus quotation predicates, equivalent Fibonacci variants,
  and a fold control; diagnostics rather than an application score.
- `captures.toy`: checked deep capture-free call chains and repeated wide local
  scopes, isolating dynamic lookup and capture-storage costs.
- `cross-language/`: optional checksum-validated microbenchmarks and log-report
  application ports, comparing Joy0, current Joy, Lua/LuaJIT, Python, and
  Node (JIT and JIT-disabled), with optional Janet/Bun/Gforth adapters; run
  separately under Linux and retain raw samples with `--output`;
- `construction-patterns.toy`: equivalent captured, stack-threaded, list,
  `infra`, and one-shot conversion patterns for vectors, maps, and strings;
- `control-ownership.toy`: ambient collection updates through state-threading
  control combinators, guarding against accidental snapshot retention;
- `deferred.c`: public C API queueing and VM draining for a burst of deferred
  callback arguments;
- `dispatch.toy`: inline native calls versus user-word dispatch.
- `deque.toy`: unique/shared endpoint updates, pops, wraparound, and projection.
- `graph-search.toy`: BFS and Dijkstra scaling for the standalone graph
  examples under `examples/graphs/`.
- `list.toy`: constant-time front operations, linear traversal, and
  copy-left/share-right concatenation.
- `json.toy`: decode and encode scaling for the Toy-written `core:json`
  package.
- `log-report.toy`: text parsing, per-route aggregation, sorting, and reporting
  using `examples/log-report/`, with fixed and growing route cardinality.
- `map.toy`: unique growth and replacement, shared updates, lookup, and
  absent-key deletion.
- `set.toy`: unique growth, duplicate insertion, shared updates, membership,
  present/absent removal, algebra, and relation predicates.
- `pqueue.toy`: unique/shared heap updates, non-consuming peek, pop, and ordered
  pair projection.
- `particles.toy`: repeated floating-point state transformations using
  `examples/particles/`, varying population and timestep count independently.
- `runtime-internals.toy`: native continuations, dynamic captures, predicate
  stack snapshots, and recursion-scheme scheduling.
- `sequence-algorithms.toy`: sort and unique crossover workloads by size,
  shape, and sequence family.
- `string.toy`: short-string storage, byte extraction and traversal, flat
  string transforms, splitting, and incremental growth.
- `vector.toy`: unique `push-back`, non-shrinking `pop-back`, indexed reads,
  and unique/shared-left `concat`.

## Call-Path Diagnostics

Use the phase runner to distinguish individual call shapes instead of treating
the entire diagnostic process as one score:

```console
python3 benchmarks/measure-call-path.py \
  --baseline path/to/baseline/toy --toy path/to/candidate/toy \
  --runs 9 --output build/call-path.json
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s benchmarks -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

Each fresh process verifies all ten checksums. The runner validates the complete
output, discards one warmup per executable, alternates paired execution order,
and records raw wall-time samples and executable/source hashes. Phase order is
fixed within each process. The Fibonacci variants deliberately use the same
naive algorithm; they compare execution idioms, not good application algorithms.
Quotation predicates sandbox the ambient stack, so their timing includes more
than the quotation call alone.

The [call-path experiment](results/2026-09-11-call-path.md) records four rejected
runtime prototypes. It illustrates why an isolated call-loop win or a reduction
in continuation counters is not sufficient evidence of an application gain.

## Application Workloads

The [log reporter](../examples/log-report/README.md) and
[headless simulation](../examples/particles/README.md) are runnable consumer
examples. Their benchmark drivers import the same packages; they do not
contain faster, benchmark-only implementations. No Python is required to run
the examples or their Toy regressions.

```console
nob benchmark log-report particles --runs 7
```

These drivers check their results on every run. Log cases use an independently
derived route-sensitive aggregate checksum and report row count. Particle
cases check population, position sums, energy, and coordinate bounds. A
separate Python standard-library checker compares every group and every
particle component to independent implementations, including randomized text,
fractional report means, multiple wall crossings, and zero-gravity energy:

```console
python3 benchmarks/check-applications.py --toy build/gcc/release/toy
python3 benchmarks/check-applications.py --emit-checksums
```

Nob measures the whole process, including package loading, generated fixtures,
and correctness checks. Use the phase-aware runner to distinguish application
work from that overhead:

```console
python3 benchmarks/measure-applications.py --runs 7
python3 benchmarks/measure-applications.py \
  --baseline path/to/baseline/toy --toy path/to/candidate/toy --runs 7 --json
```

The runner warms up each executable once, alternates execution order when
comparing two builds, and reports phase medians and median paired
candidate/baseline ratios. JSON includes raw samples. Log `application` time
is analysis plus report generation; particle `application` time is advancement.
`setup` and process `wall` are reported separately. File I/O and terminal
printing are not part of application timing. Very short phases, especially
reports of just 16 routes, cannot resolve small effects reliably.

Log input grows from 2,000 to 32,000 records, first with 16 routes and then with
one distinct route per two records. Particles vary from 250 to 4,000 at fixed
steps, and from 10 to 160 steps at fixed population. These are deterministic
synthetic inputs, not evidence from established Toy production applications.
Together they broaden coverage beyond JSON and graph search, but do not
represent recursive interpreters, interactive tools, host callbacks, streaming
I/O, or large graph topologies. See the
[application workload experiment](results/2026-09-05-application-workloads.md)
for source-level alternatives, scaling results, and remaining limitations.
